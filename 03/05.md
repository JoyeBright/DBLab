# Even more aliasing

Get the average duration in hours for all films, aliased as `avg_duration_hours`:
```sql
select avg(duration) / 60.0 as avg_duration_hours
from films;
```

Get the percentage of `people` who are no longer alive. Alias the result as `percentage_dead`. Remember to use `100.0` and not `100`:
```sql
select count(deathdate) * 100.0 / count(*) as percentage_dead
from people;
```

Get the number of decades the `films` table covers. Alias the result as `number_of_decades`. The top half of your fraction should be enclosed in parentheses:
```sql
select count(distinct release_year / 10) as number_of_decades
from films;
```
