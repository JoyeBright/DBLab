# It's AS simple AS aliasing

Get the title and net profit (the amount a film grossed, minus its budget) for all films. Alias the net profit as `net_profit`:
```sql
select title, (gross - budget) as net_profit
from films;
```

Get the title and duration in hours for all films. The duration is in minutes, so you'll need to divide by 60.0 to get the duration in hours. Alias the duration in hours as `duration_hours`:
```sql
select title, (duration / 60.0) as duration_hours
from films;
```
